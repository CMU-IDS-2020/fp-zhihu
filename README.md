## Abstract

As the biggest online question-answer site for programmers in the world, Stack Overflow has a large impact on the developer community. However, through their public dataset, we discovered a continued decline in community activity and question-response rates. We propose our Stack Overflow helper with interactive visualization design by adding the recommendation system for tag-user and user-user recommendations to reduce the answer time, increase the answer rate, and facilitate interaction between users. Our tool fills in the gaps in the existing functionality of the Stack Overflow website. It is developed by Streamlit and currently [available online](https://share.streamlit.io/cmu-ids-2020/fp-zhihu/main).
